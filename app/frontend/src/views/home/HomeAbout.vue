      <div class="about-block-content">
        The Seafarers Cafe are a group of friends and creators that hold a passion across a wide variety of interests. These interests range from discussions on upcoming video/board games, the finer points of coffee and tea, to exploring and trying out new technologies.
        This may seem like a broad range of topics, but this resulted from each of our sailors having a similar background in technology. Whether it be in programming, security, or even some electrical engineering... these trades bonded our ship.
        <br>
        <br>
        If we have any lofty goals and where we wish to take this voyage, we one day aspire to build a coffee brand around our theme! One in which we believe those who share our interests might find themselves another home.
